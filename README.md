<h2>About</h2>

A public repo showcasing projects I've been involved in, either entirely or partially as in team projects.

<h2>Team Projects</h2>
Projects I've been involved in with major contributions.

1. Mealer (Android App) [<a href="https://github.com/justin-zz/Projects/blob/main/Project%20Files/Mealer%20Project%20Report.pdf" target="_blank">Report</a>]
   <br>A 5-person project we undertook to create an aesthetic and intuitive application that connects customers directly to cooks.
   - Database hosted on Firebase & developed on Android Studio
   - Design patterns like composition used to manage users as Clients/Cooks/Admins; among others
   - DP search engine for meals
     
2. Sunshine Dentist Clinic (Web App) [<a href="https://github.com/justin-zz/Projects/blob/main/Project%20Files/Sunshine%20Dentist%20Clinic%20Project%20Report.pdf" target="_blank">Report</a>]
   <br>Another project undertaken by 5 people to create a website for a hospital that can handle several branches.
   - Built with Java using PostgreSQL, Apache Tomcat and hosted locally w/ SoftEther VPN
   - Using JSP & servlets, users would smoothly navigate through their views: such as dentists, patients, recepcionists, etc...
   - Recepcionists, for instance would be able to create appointments and specify medical resources to be used as well as relevant teeth
